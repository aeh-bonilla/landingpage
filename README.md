# landingpage

This repository hosts the necessary code for the landing page project that is being built for NAO's Full Stack developer training.

A landing page is a web page that is specifically designed to persuade visitors to take a certain action or engage with a product or service. 
These pages are typically used in advertising campaigns and are designed to be simple and focused, with a clear call-to-action. Landing pages 
are often used to generate leads, sell products, or promote events. They can include elements such as forms, videos, and images to help persuade 
visitors to take action. With the right design and messaging, landing pages can be an effective tool for converting visitors into customers.
